# ESE5192BProposal

## Outline & Components

Proposal:

I am using a digital keyboard switch that is can by selecting y or n keyboard. The y keyletter turns on the led and n turns off. I think this suits my experience and has some sort of input and output response.
Equipment: Breadboard, resistor, switch,  and LED.
